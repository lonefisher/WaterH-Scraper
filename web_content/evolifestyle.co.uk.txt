About Us

Evo Lifestyle Products began life as Trolley Bags UK ltd. However, with the addition of several new and exciting brands, we’ve evolved into Evo Lifestyle Products, a distributor of innovative homeware and lifestyle products. Based in the South West, we supply individual retailers, national chains, wholesalers and buying groups based all over the world. We have a team of dedicated staff based in our office and warehouse facility in Devon and we pride ourselves on excellent customer service and providing a first class distribution service. Our mission remains to source the best innovative lifestyle solutions available across the globe to supply our customers in the UK & Ireland and around the world. If you’d like to stock our products, or have a product that we can distribute for you, 
we’d love to hear from you
